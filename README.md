AI_OMICS_RESEARCH INTERNSHIP

This is my official repository of the AI and Omics Research Internship (2025).

This internship is divided into four progressive modules:
Module I: Getting Started with R Programming: Introduction to RStudio, project setup, data handling, and basic scripting.
Module II: High-Dimensional Data Analysis: Focused on statistical techniques, visualization, and handling omics-scale datasets.
Module III: Genomic Data Analysis: Includes pre-processing, normalization, and differential expression analysis for genomic datasets.
Module IV: Case Studies: Applications Using RNA-seq and Microarray Data: Involving end-to-end pipeline analysis from data preprocessing, machine learning to pathway ana;ysis and result interpretation.
